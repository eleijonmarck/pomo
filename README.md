# Pomo

The first ever built and most performant pomodoro timer for your terminal.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone <repo>
$ cargo run start
```

## Motivation

I love to get productive with my pomodoro timers. However once I made the move to linux, I used Pomodroid which took up 25% of the CPU and could not find a alternative.
This is the take to make a pomodoro timer the most performant possible and easy to use through your terminal.
